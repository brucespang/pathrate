Overview of pathrate
--------------------
pathrate measures the capacity of a network path from host S (sender) to host R
(receiver). The capacity of a path, aka bottleneck bandwidth, is the maximum
IP-layer throughput that a flow can get in the path from S to R. The capacity
does not depend on the load of the path. 

* The capacity of a path is not the same metric as the available bandwidth
of a path. The later takes into account the cross traffic load in the path, and
it is less than the capacity. Also, the capacity is different than the Bulk
Transfer Capacity (BTC) metric, currently standardized by the IETF. The BTC is
the maximum throughput that a TCP connection can get in the path, when it is
only limited by the network.

* pathrate requires that you have access at both end-points of the 
network path (i.e., you have to be able to run pathrate at both S and R).  This
makes the tool harder to use, but it is the only way to avoid distorting the
measurements with the reverse path from R to S. 

* You can run pathrate from user-space, and you don't need any superuser 
privileges.

* Pathrate takes normally about 15 minutes to run. Even though we could
simplify the measurement process so that it takes much shorter, we chose to
focus on accuracy rather than on execution speed.  Notice that the capacity of
a path is a static metric that does not change unless if there are routing or
infrastructure changes in the path.  Consequently, the long execution time of
pathrate should not be a concern. 

* It is important to run pathrate from relatively idle hosts. Before 
running pathrate, make sure that there are no other CPU or I/O intensive
processes running. If there are, it is likely that they will interact with
pathrate's user-level packet timestamping, and the results that you'll get may
be quite inaccurate.

* Certain links use load balancing (e.g., Cisco's standard CEF load-sharing). 
In those cases, even though a certain "fat link" may have a capacity X, an IP
flow will only be able to see a maximum bandwidth of X/n, where n is the number
of "sub-links" (e.g., ATM PVCs) that make up the "fat link". 

* In paths that are limited by Gigabit Ethernet interfaces,
the Pathrate final capacity estimate is often less than 1000Mbps. The major
issue there is whether the two end-hosts can truly saturate a Gigabit Ethernet
path, even when they transfer MTU UDP packets.  We have observed that in order
to saturate a GigE interface, it is important that end-hosts have a 64-bit PCI
bus (together with a GHz processor and a decent GigE NIC of course).  In other
words, Pathrate cannot measure a nominal network capacity if the end-hosts are
not really able to use that capacity.

* Some links perform traffic shaping, providing a certain
peak rate P, while if the burst size is larger than a certain amount of bytes,
the maximum rate is reduced to a lower ("sustainable") rate S. In such paths,
Pathrate should measure P, not S.  Thanks to Tom Dunigan from ORNL that run
Pathrate in such paths and gave us feedback.

* In previous versions, Pathrate would sometimes report that it
cannot produce a final capacity estimate (especially, in      high-bandwidth
paths). In the new version, Pathrate will report instead a lower-bound on the
capacity of a path. 

* Internet paths are often asymmetric. The capacity of the path from S to R 
is not necessarily the same with the capacity of the path from R to S.

* For heavily loaded paths, pathrate can take a while until it reports a 
final estimate. "A while" means about half an hour. The good news is that the
capacity of a path does not change very often, unless if there is route
flapping. 

* pathrate uses UDP packets for probing the path's bandwidth, and it also 
establishes a TCP connection between the two hosts for control purposes.  The
UDP port number is 48698 (at the receiver) and the TCP port number is 48699 (at
the sender).

* pathrate does some primitive form of congestion avoidance (it will abort
after many packet losses).

* pathrate assumes that the IP and UDP headers (28 bytes totally) are
fully transmitted together with the packet payload. For links that do header
compression (RFC 1144) this will cause a slight capacity overestimation.  
 
* pathrate v2.x is significantly different than the first version, released 
in November 2000. Also, pathrate v2.x differs in certain points with the
description given in our Infocom 2001 paper.



How pathrate works
------------------
Pathrate consists of the following "run phases":

1) Initially, the tool discovers the maximum train-length that the path can
carry. The idea is that we do not want to overload the path with very long
packet trains that would cause buffer overflows. The maximum train length that
we try is 50 packets. We stop increasing the train length after three lossy
packet trains at a given train length.

2) Then, pathrate sends a number of packet trains of increasing length (called
"preliminary measurements" phase). The goal here is to detect if the narrow
link has parallel sub-channels, or if it performs traffic shaping. You can
ignore this phase until you become an "advanced user". This phase also checks
whether the path is "easy to measure" (very lightly loaded). In that case,
pathrate reports its final estimate and exits. An important part of this phase
is that pathrate computes the "bandwidth resolution" (think of it as a
histogram bin width). The final capacity estimate will be a range of this
width.

3) In this phase, called Phase I, pathrate generates a large number (1000) of
packet-pairs. The goal here is to discover all local modes in the packet-pair
bandwidth distribution. One of the Phase I modes is expected to be the capacity
of the path. The packets that pathrate sends in Phase I are of variable size,
in order to make the non-capacity local modes weaker and wider. 

4) Finally, in Phase II, pathrate generates a number (500) of packet trains of
large length. The goal here is to discover which of the Phase I local modes is
the capacity of the path. To do so, Phase II estimates the Asymptotic
Dispersion Rate (ADR) metric R, measured from the dispersion of long packet
trains. We know (see our Infocom 2001 paper) that the capacity is larger than
R. If there are several Phase I modes that are larger than R, the capacity
estimate is the mode that maximizes a certain "figure of merit" M. M depends on
the "narrowness" and the "strength" of each candidate mode in the underlying
bandwidth distribution of Phase I. The capacity mode should be narrow and
strong, i.e., to have a large value of M. 

The very final outcome of pathrate is the capacity estimate for the path. 




Building pathrate
-----------------
pathrate uses the standard configure/make approach.
$> ./configure
$> make

After you have extracted the pathrate code in a directory,
run configure in that directory. Then run make.

You should then have two executables in the pathrate directory.
1. pathrate_snd (to be run at the sender)
2. pathrate_rcv (to be run at the receiver)



Running pathrate
----------------

sender 
   For capacity estimation, first run pathrate_snd at the sender S:
   $> pathrate_snd
   By default, pathrate_snd will exit after 1 measurement.
   Use switch -i to run sender in iterative mode.
   Other options are,
        -q        : quite mode
        -v        : verbose mode
        -o <file> : print log in user specified file
        -H|-h     : print help and exit                                                                                       

receiver 
   Then, run pathrate_rcv at the receiver R:
   $> pathrate_rcv [-q|-v] [-Q] [-o|-O <filename>] [-N <filename>] [-H] -h <sender>
        -s        : hostname/ipaddress of sender
        -q        : quite mode
        -v        : verbose mode
        -Q        : Quick termination mode
        -o <file> : print log in user specified file
        -O <file> : append log in user specified file [default is pathrate.output]
        -N <file> : print output in ULM format to <file>
        -H|-h     : print help and exit
      
   [-o,-O] By default, receiver always appends detailed output to file 
   "pathrate.output". output file can be changed by specifying a filename with -o 
    switch. Remember, if the specified file already exits, it will be over-written.
    To append the output to a file use -O switch.
   
   [-q,-v] By default, receiver sends minimal output (Progress report, Local 
   modes and final output) to terminal (stdout). To completely disable any 
   message on stdout, please use -q (quite mode).
   To enable detailed output on screen, use -v (Verbose mode). Note that, log file 
   (user specified or "pathrate.output") contains exactly the same output as -v.
   
   [-N] Specify a file name to store output in netlogger compatible format.

   [-Q] If used, terminates at the end of phase 0 and give rough estimate of
   capacity by getting the average of the estimates so far. It also reports
   the coefficient of variation (standard deviation/ average). If this variation
   is large, complete run of pathrate is suggested for more accurate capacity
   estimate.



Examples
--------
Say, you want to measure the capacity from host A to host B, then run 
pathrate_snd at A and pathrate_rcv at B.

At host A,
$> ./pathrate_snd -i -q &

At host B,
$> ./pathrate_rcv -s A 

Now, if you wanted to change the default log file at receiver B,
$> ./pathrate_rcv -s A -o testrun.log

Next if you also wanted detailed output on screen and netlogger
output, 
$> ./pathrate_rcv -s A -o testrun.log -N netlogger.log -v


Changes from previous pathrate release
--------------------------------------
1) A command line options are added for users to choose different levels 
   of verbose output on the screen. It also has options for redirecting
   output to different files and appending to file instead of 
   overwriting.

2) Current version has been tested to work at high capacity paths.
   (OC-3, OC-12, Gigabit). It can detect interrupt coalescing at
   Gigabit NICs and adopt different methodology for capacity 
   estimation.

3) It can report final estimation in Universal Logger Message (ULM)
   format.
